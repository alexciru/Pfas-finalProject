## SETUP
* make sure you see our custom deep_sort library at tracking/deep_sort (branched from original deepsort repo)
* download and unzip the pre-generated detections and networks dirs from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18fKzfqnqhqW3s9zwsCbnVJ5XF2JFeqMp) inside the notebooks/tracking directory (NOT inside deep_sort)
* if something doesn't work, see instructions [here](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) for deepsort

## Dependencies
* should be in requirements_mac.txt or requirements.txt in root directory (pfas-finalProject)
* if something is broken, notebooks/tracking/IGNORE_requirements_mac.txt which is just added for sanity purposes
and is last known working version of requirements (on macOS)
