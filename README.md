Pfas-finalProject
==============================

final project of pfas
------------
Install dependecies
`pip install requirements.txt`   NOT UPDATED YET

Download Data:  
`dvc pull`  
Might require log in to the Google Account - if dont work ask Alex to check account auths  



------------  
1. Seq_1:   blablabla
2. Seq_2:
3. Seq_3: bla blabla

Calibration are squares of arround 10 cm
------------  
Goals:

- Calibrate and rectify the stereo input.
- Process the input images to detect objects in the environment and track them in 3D,
even under occlusions.
- Train a machine learning system that can classify unseen images into the 3 classes
(pedestrians, cyclists, and cars) based either on 2D or 3D data.
o Use the web or/and capture your own images to create your training set. The
image sequences 1 and 2 provided with the project will constitute your
validation set and the sequence 3 your testing set
